     <h2>The story</h2>
   

     <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer">“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</q> 
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad,</em>”</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!” </q>Again, he said,<q class="farmer">“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</q>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad </em>— because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.

     <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
     <p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad </em>are just one perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
